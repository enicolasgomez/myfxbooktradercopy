    <br>
    Each time you use the website, the current version of the Terms and Conditions
    will apply. Accordingly, when you use the website, you should check the date of the
    Terms and Conditions (which appears at the bottom) and review any changes since the last version.
    <br><br>
    Please review carefully the entire website Terms and Conditions before agreeing to them.
    By viewing or using this website or any part of it, you agree to all of the Terms and Conditions of this website.
    <br><br>
    The term Myfxbook or "us" or "we" refers to the owner of the website
    whose. The term "you" refers to the user or viewer of our website.
    
    <br>The use of this website is subject to the following terms of use: <br>  <br>
    
    <br>
    
    <ul class="news">
        <li>
            All performance claims found on Myfxbook about trading systems or strategies must be regarded as hypothetical. Use of Myfxbook to offer or subscribe to a trading system or strategy indicates you agree to our Terms and Conditions. Before using any systems or strategies listed on Myfxbook you
            should be aware that there is often a vast difference between hypothetical results and real-life trading results achievable in a real brokerage account, and real-live results are almost always vastly worse than hypothetical results. Performance results for systems and strategies listed on
            Myfxbook do not take into account fees, spreads and/or trading commissions that may be charged by your broker or a money manager. Please consult with your broker for information on these costs. Additional information on how Myfxbook calculates performance data can be found on the Myfxbook <a class="underline" href="https://www.myfxbook.com/help">Help</a> page.
        </li>
        <li>
            HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS HAVE MANY INHERENT LIMITATIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. NO REPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE THAT ANY ACCOUNT WILL OR IS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE PROFITS OR LOSSES SIMILAR TO THOSE SHOWN. IN FACT, THERE ARE FREQUENTLY SHARP DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HYPOTHETICAL
            PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND THE ACTUAL RESULTS SUBSEQUENTLY ACHIEVED BY ANY PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM. ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS IS THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PREPARED WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT. IN ADDITION, HYPOTHETICAL TRADING DOES NOT INVOLVE FINANCIAL RISK,
            AND NO HYPOTHETICAL TRADING RECORD CAN COMPLETELY ACCOUNT FOR THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL RISK IN ACTUAL TRADING. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ABILITY TO WITHSTAND LOSSES OR ADHERE TO A PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM IN SPITE OF TRADING LOSSES ARE MATERIAL POINTS WHICH CAN ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING
            RESULTS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER FACTORS RELATED TO THE MARKETS IN GENERAL OR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY SPECIFIC TRADING PROGRAM WHICH CANNOT BE FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PREPARATION OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND ALL OF WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING
            RESULTS.

            Trading is never without risk and you are urged to carefully read and consider the following before utilizing any or all of our services:
            (a) No aspect of the Site is intended to provide, or should be construed as providing, any investment, tax or other financial related advice of any kind. You should not consider any content on the Site to be a substitute for professional financial advice. While individual participants may
            offer investment advice or opinions and/or effect a transaction which may be subsequently copied by another trader, such advice, opinions, or trades amount to nothing more than exchanges between persons who may be anonymous or unidentifiable or simply the execution of a trade by such
            traders. Myfxbook does not provide investment advice directly, indirectly, implicitly, or in any manner whatsoever by making such information and/or features available to you. You should use any information gathered from here and/or utilize the AutoTrade features only as a starting
            point for your own independent research.
            (b) The Site, Services, and AutoTrade features are provided by Myfxbook solely for informational purposes. Myfxbook and/or any on its behalf, including its affiliates and their employees and agents are not investment or financial advisers. ANY INVESTMENT DECISIONS YOU MAY MAKE IN
            RELIANCE ON INFORMATION WHICH IS AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE OR AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF THE AutoTrade TRADING FEATURES, ARE AT YOUR OWN RISK AND Myfxbook, AND ITS PARTNERS, AFFILIATES, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSSES THAT YOU MAY SUSTAIN. YOU ARE SOLELY AND EXCLUSIVELY
            RESPONSIBLE FOR DETERMINING WHETHER ANY INVESTMENT, OR STRATEGY, OR ANY OTHER PRODUCT OR SERVICE IS APPROPRIATE OR SUITABLE FOR YOU BASED ON YOUR INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES AND PERSONAL AND FINANCIAL SITUATION.
            (c) If you choose to copy specific traders and/or trades and/or to engage in transactions based on content on the Site, then such decision and transactions and any consequences flowing therefrom are your sole responsibility.
            (d) A copied traderâs positions will be copied with the same proportional amounts and with the same leverage, to the maximum extent possible. All such positions will be closed automatically if and when closed by the copied trader for whatsoever reason, without providing any further notice
            and without any action on your part and/or if the copied trader positions were closed manually by the follower.
            (e) You may achieve a materially different result than the AutoTrade system that you followed, especially if you place additional trades in your account or you modify or cancel an order generated by the AutoTrader system.
            (f) Any past performance indicated on this Site is not indicative of future results. Anyone investing should be able and prepared to bear a loss of his or her entire investment. You are fully responsible for any losses you may sustain as a result of our automatic execution of instructions
            generated as a result of the utilization of any of the AutoTrade trading Features.

    <b>AutoTrade Refund Policy</b><br>
    Myfxbook will issue a refund to an investor for losses caused by Platform Errors, limited to the amount of rebates Myfxbook recieved from the investor's broker for the investor's account, if the investor provides timely notice of the error to Myfxbook as described below. A Platform Error occurs if a trading signal that should have been rejected according to the investor's account settings is accepted by Myfxbook and submitted to the investor's broker, or if a trading signal that should have been accepted according to the investor's account settings is rejected by Myfxbook and not submitted to the investor's broker. Myfxbook shall not be responsible for refunding lost profits resulting from Platform Errors under any circumstances.
    <br>
    Errors of third party signal providers or brokers shall not be considered Platform Errors, and Myfxbook shall not be responsible for refunding losses or lost profits resulting from such errors under any circumstances.
    <br>
    In order to receive a refund of losses caused by Platform Errors, you must notify Myfxbook in writing of your potential claim. You must deliver the written notice to Myfxbook as soon as you knew, or should have known, of the Platform Error, but in any event, no later than 24  hours after the Platform Error occurred. If Myfxbook does not receive such notice from you within 24  hours after the Platform Error occurred, it will not be liable for any losses resulting from the Platform Error.
    <br>If Myfxbook confirms that a Platform Error occurred with respect to your account, and you provided the required notice to Myfxbook within 24  hours, you will receive a refund of your losses caused by the Platform Error (not including lost profits).
    You are required to review your account statements and monitor your account status at least daily to ensure that the trades you ordered were placed, and that all trades that were made on your account were authorized by you.
    <br>
    Except as expressly provided by this refund policy, neither Myfxbook, nor our officers, principals, employees or agents shall be liable to any person for any losses, damages, costs or expenses (including, but not limited to, loss of profits, loss of use, direct, indirect, incidental or consequential damages) resulting from any errors in the Myfxbook trading platform.

                            HIGH RISK WARNING: Foreign exchange trading carries a high level of risk that may not be suitable for all investors. Leverage creates additional risk and loss exposure. Before you decide to
